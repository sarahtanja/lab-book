# February '23 Goals

## Primary Focus

### Conduct 1st Committee Meeting

- [x] Write committee agreements (complete on 01FEB23)
- [x] Build ‘committee presentation’ blog post ([here](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/committee%20meetings/committee-no1/)) (complete on 05FEB23)
- [x] Host meeting (complete on 06FEB23)
- [x] Integrate feedback into [master’s thesis committee meeting #](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/committee%20meetings/committee-no1/#feedback)1 blog (complete on 07FEB23)


### DNA/RNA Extraction Protocols

- [x]  Research DNA/RNA extraction kits (compete on 05FEB23)
- [x] Buy Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit , 10 preps ($106.70, requested 08FEB23 on Hall Grant Budget)
- [x] Receive kits (complete on 23FEB23)
- [x] Draft [protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/lab/protocol-DNARNAextraction/) (complete on 15FEB23 )
- [ ] Locate (… or buy or borrow) 300uL/500uL & 1000uL pipettes & tips
- [ ] Protocol dry-run walk-thru with IBIS mentee
- [ ] Edit/amend [protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/lab/protocol-DNARNAextraction/)
- [ ] Trial methods with subset of samples **Note:** *We originally thought about using Callum's coral fragments for the trial, but these were not held at -80C, and therefore the RNA step would not work properly*

### Get Sequencing Quotes

- [x] Get general idea of costs ( $80/sample for 16S & \$200/sample for RNAseq )
- [ ] Answer/identify common quote questions:
	- [ ] What type of library prep is needed?
	- [ ] What is the minimum number of reads per sample?
	- [ ] How many samples to sequence?

- [ ] UW Northwest Genomics Center
- [ ] Azenta Life Sciences (previously Genewiz)
- [ ] Univ. of Texas
- [ ] Mr. DNA Lab
- [ ] FYR Diagnostics (20% off promo)



## Supporting Roles

- [x] Complete SMEA/FISH 539 coursework
- [x] Ongoing coordinating for GSIS speaker Dr. Nicola S. Smith
- [x] Ongoing participation in Student Advisory Council 
  - [x] CoEnv Strategic Planning student working group
  - [x]  CoEnv Assistant Dean of Diversity Equity & Inclusion (ADDEI) hire student input
- [x] Ongoing mentoring with [IBIS mentee Nora Hessen](https://github.com/norahess/ibis)
  - [x] develop project (DNA/RNA extraction & alpha & beta diversity analysis!)
  - [x] lab training & certificates
  - [x] brainstorming & meeting every Wednesday for 2hrs 

- [ ] Apply for FHL Marine Botany TAship
- [x] Apply for WSG Grad Student Assistant, locally sourced seafood project

### Apply for [PCC Climate Solutions Project Funding](https://pcc.uw.edu/research/funding-opportunities/)

$5k max for solutions-based projects, capstone programs (IBIS), outreach efforts with community organizations and partners. Can be used for Financial Support, Training, Publication & Travel. Rolling application. Would like to apply for this to be used to help IBIS mentee, via more sequencing or publication? Need to brainstorm how to angle ‘solutions-based’ project.
