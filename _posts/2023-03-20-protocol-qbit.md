The aim of this protocol is to take the extracted RNA from the [Dual DNA & RNA Extraction Protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/lab/protocol-DNARNAextraction/) step and check it for **integrity & quality**. This is a necessary quality check (QC) because we want to make sure the samples we send for sequencing actually have enough good RNA in them to sequence. 

The Qubit allows us to measure RNA integrity & quality (IQ) extracted in our samples.  For high-quality RNA, we're looking for long and intact strands of RNA.

  {: .notice--warning}

  **Danger Notice:** Kit contains DMSO 67-68-5 in the RNA dye Reagent 200X concentrate, a combustible liquid that is a mild skin and eye irritant and may be absorbed into the body through the skin. If accidental contact with skin or eye happens, rinse with plenty of water, immediate medical attention is not required (according to the [SDS](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2FSDS%2FQ10210COMPONENTA_MTR-NALT_EN.pdf))

## Protocol

### Quick-Reference Overview

![qbit ]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/qbit-quick.png)*infographic sourced from [Qubit RNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit Quick Reference](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQRC10210.pdf)*



### Step 1. Set up 2 assay tubes for the standards and 1 tube for each sample

- [ ] label assay tube lids

**Warning Notice:** Label only the cap of the assay tube, the sides need to remain 	 clear for the fluorometer to penetrate through and read the sample
{: .notice--warning}

- [ ] rip off sheet of foil to cover sample tube rack to protect from light

**Warning Notice:** Qubit RNA BR dye-reagent (component A) is light sensitive, and must be kept in the dark (tube wrapped in foil)
{: .notice--warning}

### Step 2. Prepare Working Solution

- [ ] calculate how much working solution you need

  standard #1 - 190uL working solution. 10uL 

  standard #2 - 190uL working solution

  sample 1      - 199uL working solution

  sample 2      - 199uL working solution

  sample 3      - 199uL working solution

  .. etc.
  $$
  2*190uL + no. of samples *199uL = Working-Solution-Volume
  $$

**Note:** The final volume in each tube must be 200 µL. Each standard tube requires 190 µL of Qubit™ working solution, and each sample tube requires anywhere from 180–199 µL. Ensure that you have sufficient Qubit™ working solution to accommodate all standards and samples, with a little 'extra'. For example, to prepare enough working solution for 2 standards and 8 samples: 
$$
2*190uL + 8*199uL = 1972uL = 1.972mL \approx 2mL
$$
{: .notice--info}

For a 2mL 1 : 200 dilution of dye-reagent : buffer,  pipette 10uL of Qubit dye-reagent plus 1990uL of Qubit buffer into a 15mL falcon tube. 

- [ ] 

- [ ] take 15mL falcon tube

### Step 3. Pipette Working Solution, Standards, & Samples into assay tubes



### Step 4. 

### Step 5. Read Samples

**Warning Notice:** Qubit™ assays delivers optimal performance when all solutions are at room temperature; temperature fluctuations can influence the accuracy of the assay. To minimize temperature fluctuations, insert all assay tubes into the Qubit™ Fluorometer only for as much time as it takes for the instrument to measure the fluorescence; the Qubit™ Fluorometer can raise the temperature of the assay solution significantly, even over a period of a few minutes. Do not hold the assay tubes in your hand before reading because this warms the solution and results in a low
reading.
