The aim of this protocol is to take the extracted RNA from the [Dual DNA & RNA Extraction Protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/lab/protocol-DNARNAextraction/) step and check it for **integrity & quality**. This is a necessary quality check (QC) because we want to make sure the samples we send for sequencing actually have enough good RNA in them to sequence. 

The Qubit allows us to measure RNA integrity & quality (IQ) extracted in our samples.  For high-quality RNA, we're looking for long and intact strands of RNA.

  {: .notice--warning}

  **Danger Notice:** Kit contains DMSO 67-68-5 in the RNA Reagent 200X concentrate, a combustible liquid that is a mild skin and eye irritant and may be absorbed into the body through the skin. If accidental contact with skin or eye happens, rinse with plenty of water, immediate medical attention is not required (according to the [SDS](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2FSDS%2FQ10210COMPONENTA_MTR-NALT_EN.pdf))

## Protocol

### Quick-Reference Overview

![qbit ]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/qbit-quick.png)*infographic sourced from [Qubit RNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit Quick Reference](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQRC10210.pdf)*



### Step 1. Set up 2 assay tubes for the standards and 1 tube for each user sample

- [ ] label tube lids

**Warning Notice:** Label only the cap of the assay tube, the sides need to remain clear for the fluorometer to penetrate through and read the sample
{: .notice--warning}

### Step 2. Prepare Working Solution

- [ ] calculate how much working solution you need

  **Note:** The final volume in each tube must be 200 µL. Each standard tube requires 190 µL of Qubit™ working solution, and each sample tube requires anywhere from 180–199 µL. Ensure that you have sufficient Qubit™ working solution to accommodate all standards and samples. For example, for 8 samples, prepare enough working solution for the samples and 2 standards: ∼200 μL per tube in 10 tubes yields 2 mL of working solution (10 μL of Qubit™ reagent plus 1990 μL of Qubit™ buffer).

- [ ] take 15mL falcon tube

### Step 3.

### Step 4. 

### Step 5. Read Samples

**Warning Notice:** Qubit™ assays delivers optimal performance when all solutions are at room temperature; temperature fluctuations can influence the accuracy of the assay. To minimize temperature fluctuations, insert all assay tubes into the Qubit™ Fluorometer only for as much time as it takes for the instrument to measure the fluorescence; the Qubit™ Fluorometer can raise the temperature of the assay solution significantly, even over a period of a few minutes. Do not hold the assay tubes in your hand before reading because this warms the solution and results in a low
reading.
