The aim of this protocol is to take coral fragments that have been snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extract both DNA for downstream archaea & bacteria microbiome 16S Microbiome Sequencing and RNA for downstream coral-host tissue Tag-seq or RNA-seq analysis. 

>  In plain, I want to answer 'who is there?' regarding the bacterial community, and 'what is the coral doing?' regarding gene expression. 

The benefits of doing DNA and RNA extraction together are that it saves time, money, & sample material. It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*. 

The challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity. 

This protocol relies heavily on the Zymo Research [Protocol PDF](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) & URI Putnam Lab Emma Strand's notebook post on '[Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/)', with a few alterations suggested by Zymo tech on [March 28th 2023](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/blog/daily-log/#28-mar-2023-t) regarding [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf).

### Randomize Sample Processing

Make sure to randomize which samples are processed in each batch to reduce 'batch effects'!

See ['Randomize Sample Processing'](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/rand-sample-processing.Rmd) script as an example.

Think about how many samples you can process at once, and your kit, centrifuge, and homogenizer capacity.



## Lab Setup

### Setup Lab Bench 

1.  Set out 

### Sterilize Lab Bench

### Label Tubes

The samples originate from their 1.5mL cryo-vials, which are labelled with their cryo_id. Since it's important to keep track of which samples were extracted using the same kit, the same reagents, the same day, etc.  for batch effects, I will use extraction IDs (extr1, extr2, extr3 , etc.) to label samples that were processed together. 

Each sample will need the following  7 tubes labelled:

![label-7-tubes-diagram]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/label-tube-diagram.jpeg)

The intermediate tubes should be labelled with the cryo_id & extraction_id 
```
1Ea extr1
```
The **FINAL** tubes should be labelled with cryo_id, DNA/RNA, extraction_id, date (ddMMMyy), & initials
```
1Ea
RNA
extr1
10APR23
SST
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**Important Notes! ‚ö†Ô∏è:** 

- **Use [ethanol-proof lab markers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09L3Q99WL/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9ocXBfc2hhcmVk&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWUpaVTc1M0pRMVImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxMTgzODBJOFI3QlZFQ0pKQUsmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDc2MTE0M1ExRUdBSkEwOFBBRiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2hxcF9zaGFyZWQmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) to label tubes** *(ethanol is added to the green spin away collection tube)*
- **Label collection tubes, not filters!**
- **Always wear lab gloves that have been sterilized before handling tubes!**
- **Shake tubes out of their bags onto sterilized surface, don't 'reach in' (this reduces potential contamination)**

### Prepare Buffers 

- [ ] If using the 50-prep kit (D7003), add `96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol)` to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate. 

  ‚Äã		*If using the 10-prep kit, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol.*
- [ ] Reconstitute lyophilized DNase I with `DNase/RNase-Free Water` and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots. 

  - [ ] 50-prep, add 275 ¬µl water 
  - [ ] 10-prep, add 55 ¬µl water 

- [ ] Reconstitute lyophilized Proteinase K at 20 mg/ml with Proteinase K Storage Buffer and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots. 

  - [ ] 50-prep, (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer 
  - [ ] 10-prep, (5 mg), add 0.26 ml buffer 

- [ ] To prepare a 1X solution of DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢, add an equal volume of nuclease-free water (not provided) to the DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢ (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix well.

## Extraction Steps

1. Take [dry-ice](#dry-ice) cooler to -80 freezer,  pull out frozen samples and place them in the dry-ice cooler. Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer.
