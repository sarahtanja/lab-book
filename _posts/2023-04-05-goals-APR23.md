# April '23 Goals

## Primary Focus

### DNA/RNA Extractions & Qubit!

- [ ] Currently waiting to receive the  'Mortexer' ... can't do extractions until we get that instrument!

- [ ] 1st round:
  - [ ] 1-Ea
  - [ ] 2-Ea
- [ ] 2nd round: 
  - [ ] 1-CAa
  - [ ] 1-CHa
  - [ ] 1-LAa
  - [ ] 1-LHa
  - [ ] 1-HAa
  - [ ] 1-HHa
  - [ ] 1-OAa
  - [ ] 1-OHa

### Send off Samples for Sequencing Service

- [ ] pick quote provider
- [ ] send for sequencing ( 2-4 weeks )

### FISH 546 in SP23

- [ ] prepare scripts to do RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis in-class 
- [ ] use 'fake data' from publicly available *M. capitata* RNA-seq data

## Supporting Roles

- [x] Ongoing coordinating for GSIS speaker Dr. Nicola S. Smith

- [x] Ongoing participation in Student Advisory Council 
  
- [x] Ongoing mentoring with [IBIS mentee Nora Hessen](https://github.com/norahess/ibis)
  - [ ] laboratory work! do DNA/RNA extraction together
  

## Looking Ahead...

![gantt-timeline]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/gantt-timeline.png)

#### Spring 2023

May

- analyze sequences with Nora for IBIS project (QA/QCâ€¦ both run same analysis and see if we get same result?)

- Celebrate IBIS mentee project completion
- assess how we proceed with extraction & sequencing (did we see something interesting to warrant paying for more sequences? do we need to think about finding additional funding to pay for more sequencing?)
- continue bioinformatics pipelines



#### Summer 2023

June

- June 9th: Spring Quarter ends
- June 10th: FHL Marine Botany TAship starts at Friday Harbor Labs! 
- begin drafting manuscript(s)

July

- July 15th: FHL Marine Botany TAship ends!
- continue drafting manuscript
- continue bioinformatics pipelines

Aug

- continue drafting manuscript
- continue bioinformatics pipelines
