## three domains of life

- Eukaryotes - nucleus

- Bacteria - no nucleus

- Archaea - no nucleus

## the central dogma of biology 

DNA --->[[`transcription`](https://www.labxchange.org/library/items/lb:LabXchange:1d4afb7e:lx_simulation:1)]---> mRNA--->[[`translation`](https://www.labxchange.org/library/items/lb:LabXchange:049914b8:lx_simulation:1)]---> polypeptide-chain--->[modification]--->protein

Differences in [`translation`](https://youtu.be/WNZf4ip_R9s) between eukaryotes (human cell) and prokaryotes (bacterium)

## definitions

- *genome* - an organism's complete set of DNA sequences across all chromosomes, including all genes, and ultimately the three-dimensional form that it takes 

- *epigenomics* - modifications to DNA that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence; primarily DNA methylation and histone modification

- *transcriptome* - an organism's complete set of RNA
- *microsatellites* - 

- microbiome  - the genomes of bacteria, archaea, and fungi that collectively reside in an environment
  - can be investigated using: Shotgun Metagenome Sequencing  and/or 16s rRNA Sequencing
- microbiota - the living community of archaea, bacteria, and fungi in an environment
-
