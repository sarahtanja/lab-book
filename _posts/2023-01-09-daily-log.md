##### 29-MAR-2023. W

- started template for DNA/RNA data extraction sheet in new repo for extractions  

- organized notes for samples in metadata

- installed git on WSL via [this tutorial](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-wsl/)

- 10 most useful command-line commands to know:

  - `git init` — creates a new local repository;
  - `git clone <repository>` — clones an existing repository;
  - `git status` — lists changed files in your working directory;
  - `git add .` — adds all current changes to the next commit;
  - `git commit` — commits previously staged files;
  - `git branch <new-branch>` — creates a new branch based on your current HEAD;
  - `git checkout <branch>` — switches to a different HEAD branch;
  - `git push <remote> <branch>` — publishes local changes on a remote repository;
  - `git pull <remote> <branch>` — downloads changes from a remote repository and integrates them into HEAD;
  - `git merge <branch>` — merges the specific branch into your current HEAD.

  - purchasing

    - no purchases in June!

    - > The University of Washington is transitioning from their old DOS-based system to Workday Finance, with a Go Live date of July 5th, 2023. During the transition period, there will be some disruptions to normal operations, and the continuity of research and teaching and minimizing the impact on faculty, staff, and students is the priority. There will be Restrictive Periods during which no one will be able to process purchase orders or obtain reimbursements in ARIBA. Exceptions may be made for urgent or emergency purchases. Travel reimbursements and non-travel-related reimbursements should be submitted before June 9th, and processing will resume on July 5th. Blanket Purchase Orders that are expected to be active past June 30th, 2023, will not be automatically transferred to Workday, and all continuing BPOs must be manually reentered by the College of the Environment. Navigating the transition will require patience and close partnerships between research and administrative groups

- called Zymo tech Christian Camacho ccamacho@zymoresearch.com to get advice on working with coral samples and the Zymo DNA/RNA miniprep kit:

  - bead bash for 40 minutes for microbes on mortexer vortex-mixer! This is still tested to result in good RNA, though there may be a trade-off between bead-bashing for lysis and RNA interity... see Zymo optimized lysis protocol 
  - benchmark mortexer is not a tested method for the kit.. but it's closest to the vortex genie approved method for lysis 
    - [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf)

  - mortar & pestle with liquid nitrogen, then add powder to bead bashing tube with RNA shield
  - lyophilized (freeze-dried) proteinase K is stable at room temp, it should be stored in the -20 freezer only after resuspending in the buffer
  - the DNAse 1 is similarly a lyophilized powder, but a very small amount, such that the vial looks empty

- Gathered lab supplies

  - mortar & pestles
  - alcohol burner for use with denatured ethyl alcohol
  - flint spark torch ignitor
  - found expired RNA later
  - DNAse away
  - DEPC water (does that expire?)
  - weigh papers (for powdered samples)

  NEED 

  - [ ] scoopulas (to scoop powder from mortar to weigh paper)
  - [ ] denatured ethyl alcohol (disinfect labware between samples)

##### 09-JAN-2023

- Today I setup my GitHub 'notebook'! This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record 'daily bits', and organize the procedures and methods I'll use in my thesis research

- [zbengt](https://github.com/zbengt) introduced me to '[elicit](https://elicit.org/)', a lit review search AI. I searched "What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development" and found an exciting paper titled **["Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and *in Silico* Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.793306/full)** authored by Morgan et al. in 2022

- I explored another AI, [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), and gave it the prompt "write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers" and it returned:

  - > Coral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.
    >
    > But danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it's colors torn. Mother Nature's wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.
    >
    > For mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They'll fight and strive, through day and night.
    >
    > So let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.

- I followed up with a ChatGPT prompt "what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?" and it returned:

  - > Endocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.
    >
    > One example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).
    >
    > Another example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).
    >
    > Endocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.
    >
    > Overall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.

​		                **Is this is all true!? I'll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature...

- Another ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:

  - > Examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.
    >
    > For example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.
    >
    > Other signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.
    >
