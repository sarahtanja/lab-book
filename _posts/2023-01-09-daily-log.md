##### 09-JAN-2023

- Today I setup my GitHub 'notebook'! This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record 'daily bits', and organize the procedures and methods I'll use in my thesis research

- [zbengt](https://github.com/zbengt) introduced me to '[elicit](https://elicit.org/)', a lit review search AI. I searched "What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development" and found an exciting paper titled **["Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and *in Silico* Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.793306/full)** authored by Morgan et al. in 2022

- I explored another AI, [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), and gave it the prompt "write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers" and it returned:

  - > Coral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.
    >
    > But danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it's colors torn. Mother Nature's wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.
    >
    > For mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They'll fight and strive, through day and night.
    >
    > So let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.

- I followed up with a ChatGPT prompt "what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?" and it returned:

  - > Endocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.
    >
    > One example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).
    >
    > Another example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).
    >
    > Endocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.
    >
    > Overall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.

​		                **Is this is all true!? I'll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature...

- Another ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:

  - > Examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.
    >
    > For example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.
    >
    > Other signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.
