This is my first trial post in my `_posts` directory, run through GitHub Pages.
I'm trying to figure out my workflow and am currently editing this post template in R Markdown, but am considering my 'text only' Markdown editor Typora, or possibly using Jupyter Notebooks to organize my posts in my lab notebook. It would be nice to eventually have a template or an automated process to generate a template for my notebook posts. I believe some of the researchers in the Robert's Lab have their notebooks setup in this way...
