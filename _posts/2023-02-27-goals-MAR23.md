# March '23 Goals

## Primary Focus


### DNA/RNA Extraction Protocols

- [x]  Research DNA/RNA extraction kits (compete on 05FEB23)
- [x] Buy Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit , 10 preps ($106.70, requested 08FEB23 on Hall Grant Budget)
- [x] Receive kits (complete on 23FEB23)
- [x] Draft [protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/lab/protocol-DNARNAextraction/) (complete on 15FEB23 )
- [ ] Locate (… or buy or borrow) 300uL/500uL & 1000uL pipettes & tips
- [ ] Protocol dry-run walk-thru with IBIS mentee
- [ ] Edit/amend [protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/lab/protocol-DNARNAextraction/)
- [ ] Trial methods with subset of samples **Note:** *We originally thought about using Callum's coral fragments for the trial, but these were not held at -80C, and therefore the RNA step would not work properly*

### Get Sequencing Quotes

- [x] Get general idea of costs ( $80/sample for 16S & \$200/sample for RNAseq )

- [ ] Answer/identify common quote questions:
	- [ ] What type of library prep is needed?
	- [ ] What is the minimum number of reads per sample?
	- [ ] How many samples to sequence?

- [ ] UW Northwest Genomics Center

- [ ] Azenta Life Sciences (previously Genewiz)

- [ ] Univ. of Texas

- [ ] Mr. DNA Lab

- [ ] FYR Diagnostics (20% off promo)

### Send off Samples for Sequencing Service 

- [ ] finalize extraction strategy (how many samples, from which treatments)
- [ ] pick quote provider
- [ ] extract DNA/RNA from samples **Note:** *this will be a subset of samples, likely the control vs. highest treatments*
- [ ] send for sequencing ( 2-4 weeks )

### Start FISH 546 in SP23
- [ ] setup Linux Subsystem for Windows in preparation of Bioinformatics Course
- [ ] receive sequences and prepare to do analysis in-class 


## Supporting Roles

- [ ] Complete SMEA/FISH 539 coursework WI23

- [ ] Start FISH 546 coursework SP23

- [ ] Ongoing coordinating for GSIS speaker Dr. Nicola S. Smith

- [ ] Ongoing participation in Student Advisory Council 
  - [ ] CoEnv Assistant Dean of Diversity Equity & Inclusion (ADDEI) hire student input
  
- [ ] Ongoing mentoring with [IBIS mentee Nora Hessen](https://github.com/norahess/ibis)
  - [ ] brainstorming & meeting every Wednesday for 2hrs 
  
  - [ ] laboratory work! do DNA/RNA extraction together

    

## Looking Ahead...

![gantt-timeline]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/gantt-timeline.png)

#### Spring 2023

April 
- receive trial sequences
- analyze the sequences in Bioinformatics course
- 2nd round DNA/RNA extraction, & send for sequencing

May

- analyze sequences with Nora for IBIS project (QA/QC… both run same analysis and see if we get same result?)

- Celebrate IBIS mentee project completion
- assess how we proceed with extraction & sequencing (did we see something interesting to warrant paying for more sequences? do we need to think about finding additional funding to pay for more sequencing?)
- continue bioinformatics pipelines



#### Summer 2023

June

- June 9th Spring Quarter ends
- June 20th Summer A term begins
- FHL Marine Botany TAship?
- begin drafting manuscript(s)

July

- July 19th Summer A term ends
- continue drafting manuscript
- continue bioinformatics pipelines

Aug

- continue drafting manuscript
- continue bioinformatics pipelines
