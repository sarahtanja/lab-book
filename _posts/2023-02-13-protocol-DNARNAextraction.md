The aim of this protocol is to take coral fragments that have been snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extract both DNA for downstream archaea & bacteria microbiome 16S Sequencing and RNA for downstream coral-host tissue RNA-seq analysis. 

The benefits of doing DNA and RNA extraction together are that it saves time, money, & sample material. It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*. 

This protocol relies heavily on the Zymo Research [Protocol PDF](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) & URI Putnam Lab Emma Strand's notebook post on '[Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/)'

#### Buffer Preparation

- [ ] Add 96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol) to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate (D7003). DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol. 
- [ ] Reconstitute lyophilized DNase I with DNase/RNase-Free Water and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots. #E1009-A (250 U), add 275 ¬µl water #E1009-A-S (50 U), add 55 ¬µl water 
- [ ] Reconstitute lyophilized Proteinase K at 20 mg/ml with Proteinase K Storage Buffer and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots. #D3001-2-20 (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer #D3001-2-5 (5 mg), add 0.26 ml buffer 
- [ ] To prepare a 1X solution of DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢, add an equal volume of nuclease-free water (not provided) to the DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢ (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix well.
