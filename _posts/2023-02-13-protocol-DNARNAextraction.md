The aim of this protocol is to take coral fragments that have been snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extract both DNA for downstream archaea & bacteria microbiome 16S Microbiome Sequencing and RNA for downstream coral-host tissue RNA-seq analysis. In plain, I want to answer 'who is there?' regarding the bacterial community, and 'what is the coral doing?' regarding gene expression. 

The benefits of doing DNA and RNA extraction together are that it saves time, money, & sample material. It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*. 

This protocol relies heavily on the Zymo Research [Protocol PDF](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) & URI Putnam Lab Emma Strand's notebook post on '[Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/)'

#### Buffer Preparation

- [ ] If using the 50-prep kit (D7003), add `96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol)`to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate. 

  ‚Äã		*If using the 10-prep kit, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol.*
- [ ] Reconstitute lyophilized DNase I with `DNase/RNase-Free Water` and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots. 

  - [ ] 50-prep, add 275 ¬µl water 
  - [ ] 10-prep, add 55 ¬µl water 

- [ ] Reconstitute lyophilized Proteinase K at 20 mg/ml with Proteinase K Storage Buffer and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots. 

  - [ ] 50-prep, (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer 
  - [ ] 10-prep, (5 mg), add 0.26 ml buffer 

- [ ] To prepare a 1X solution of DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢, add an equal volume of nuclease-free water (not provided) to the DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢ (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix well.
