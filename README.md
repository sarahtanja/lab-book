# Sarah Tanja lab book 

This open lab notebook will allow me to share posts, updates, methods, analyses, and data from my Masters research at the [Padilla-Gamino Lab](https://padilla-gaminolab.weebly.com/) (Marine Ecophysiology and Reproduction) on coral and kelp physiological responses to plastic pollution and heat stress.

This site was built with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) [**github pages starter**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) , and posts edited with help from [Fabrizio Musacchio's Cheat Sheet](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-11-Minimal_Mistakes_Cheat_Sheet/) many thanks!
