# Sarah Tanja lab book 

This open lab book site will allow me to share protocols, posts, data, and analyses as I work through my Masters thesis research in coral and kelp physiological responses to plastic pollution and heat stress. 

This site was built with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) [**template**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) , many thanks!
