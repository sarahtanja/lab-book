# Sarah Tanja lab book 

This open lab notebook will allow me to share posts, updates, methods, analyses, and data from my Masters research at the [Padilla-Gamino Lab](https://padilla-gaminolab.weebly.com/) (Marine Ecophysiology and Reproduction) on coral and kelp physiological responses to plastic pollution and heat stress.

This site was built with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) [**github pages starter**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) , many thanks!
